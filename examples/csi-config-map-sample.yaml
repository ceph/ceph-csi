# This is a sample configmap that helps define a Ceph cluster configuration
# as required by the CSI plugins.
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# The <cluster-id> is used by the CSI plugin to uniquely identify and use a
# Ceph cluster, the value MUST match the value provided as `clusterID` in the
# StorageClass
# The <MONValue#> fields are the various monitor addresses for the Ceph cluster
# identified by the <cluster-id>
# If a CSI plugin is using more than one Ceph cluster, repeat the section for
# each such cluster in use.
# To add more clusters or edit MON addresses in an existing configmap, use
# the `kubectl replace` command.
# The <rados-namespace> is optional and represents a radosNamespace in the pool.
# If any given, all of the rbd images, snapshots, and other metadata will be
# stored within the radosNamespace.
# NOTE: The given radosNamespace must already exists in the pool.
# NOTE: Make sure you don't add radosNamespace option to a currently in use
# configuration as it will cause issues.
# The field "cephFS.subvolumeGroup" is optional and defaults to "csi".
# NOTE: Changes to the configmap is automatically updated in the running pods,
# thus restarting existing pods using the configmap is NOT required on edits
# to the configmap.
