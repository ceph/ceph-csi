# This is a sample config map that helps define a Ceph cluster configuration
# as required by the CSI plugins.
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
# The <cluster-id> is used by the CSI plugin to uniquely identify and use a
# Ceph cluster, the value MUST match the value provided as `clusterID` in the
# StorageClass
# The <MONValue#> fields are the various monitor addresses for the Ceph cluster
# identified by the <cluster-id>
# If a CSI plugin is using more than one Ceph cluster, repeat the section for
# each such cluster in use.
# To add more clusters or edit MON addresses in an existing config map, use
# the `kubectl replace` command.
# The field "cephFS.subvolumeGroup" is optional and defaults to "csi".
# NOTE: Changes to the config map is automatically updated in the running pods,
# thus restarting existing pods using the config map is NOT required on edits
# to the config map.
