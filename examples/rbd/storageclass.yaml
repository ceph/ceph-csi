apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
   name: csi-rbd-sc
provisioner: rbd.csi.ceph.com
# If topology based provisioning is desired, delayed provisioning of
# PV is required and is enabled using the following attribute
# For further information read TODO<doc>
# volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
parameters:
   # (required) String representing a Ceph cluster to provision storage from.
   # Should be unique across all Ceph clusters in use for provisioning,
   # cannot be greater than 36 bytes in length, and should remain immutable for
   # the lifetime of the StorageClass in use.
   # Ensure to create an entry in the configmap named ceph-csi-config, based on
   # csi-config-map-sample.yaml, to accompany the string chosen to
   # represent the Ceph cluster in clusterID below
   clusterID: <cluster-id>

   # (optional) If you want to use erasure coded pool with RBD, you need to
   # create two pools. one erasure coded and one replicated.
   # You need to specify the replicated pool here in the `pool` parameter, it is
   # used for the metadata of the images.
   # The erasure coded pool must be set as the `dataPool` parameter below.
   # dataPool: <ec-data-pool>

   # (required) Ceph pool into which the RBD image shall be created
   # eg: pool: rbdpool
   pool: <rbd-pool-name>

   # Deprecated: Set thickProvision to true if you want RBD images to be fully
   # allocated on creation (thin provisioning is the default).
   # thickProvision: "false"

   # (required) RBD image features, CSI creates image with image-format 2
   # CSI RBD currently supports `layering`, `journaling`, `exclusive-lock`,
   # `object-map`, `fast-diff` features. If `journaling` is enabled, must
   # enable `exclusive-lock` too.
   # imageFeatures: layering,journaling,exclusive-lock,object-map,fast-diff
   imageFeatures: "layering"

   # (optional) Specifies whether to try other mounters in case if the current
   # mounter fails to mount the rbd image for any reason. True means fallback
   # to next mounter, default is set to false.
   # Note: tryOtherMounters is currently useful to fallback from krbd to rbd-nbd
   # in case if any of the specified imageFeatures is not supported by krbd
   # driver on node scheduled for application pod launch, but in the future this
   # should work with any mounter type.
   # tryOtherMounters: false

   # (optional) mapOptions is a comma-separated list of map options.
   # For krbd options refer
   # https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/man/8/rbd/#kernel-rbd-krbd-options
   # For nbd options refer
   # https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/man/8/rbd-nbd/#options
   # Format:
   # mapOptions: "<mounter>:op1,op2;<mounter>:op1,op2"
   # An empty mounter field is treated as krbd type for compatibility.
   # eg:
   # mapOptions: "krbd:lock_on_read,queue_depth=1024;nbd:try-netlink"

   # (optional) unmapOptions is a comma-separated list of unmap options.
   # For krbd options refer
   # https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/man/8/rbd/#kernel-rbd-krbd-options
   # For nbd options refer
   # https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/man/8/rbd-nbd/#options
   # Format:
   # unmapOptions: "<mounter>:op1,op2;<mounter>:op1,op2"
   # An empty mounter field is treated as krbd type for compatibility.
   # eg:
   # unmapOptions: "krbd:force;nbd:force"

   # The secrets have to contain Ceph credentials with required access
   # to the 'pool'.

   csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace: default

   # (optional) Specify the filesystem type of the volume. If not specified,
   # csi-provisioner will set default as `ext4`.
   csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4

   # (optional) uncomment the following to use rbd-nbd as mounter
   # on supported nodes
   # mounter: rbd-nbd

   # (optional) ceph client log location, eg: rbd-nbd
   # By default host-path /var/log/ceph of node is bind-mounted into
   # csi-rbdplugin pod at /var/log/ceph mount path. This is to configure
   # target bindmount path used inside container for ceph clients logging.
   # See docs/rbd-nbd.md for available configuration options.
   # cephLogDir: /var/log/ceph

   # (optional) ceph client log strategy
   # By default, log file belonging to a particular volume will be deleted
   # on unmap, but you can choose to just compress instead of deleting it
   # or even preserve the log file in text format as it is.
   # Available options `remove` or `compress` or `preserve`
   # cephLogStrategy: remove

   # (optional) Prefix to use for naming RBD images.
   # If omitted, defaults to "csi-vol-".
   # volumeNamePrefix: "foo-bar-"

   # (optional) Instruct the plugin it has to encrypt the volume
   # By default it is disabled. Valid values are "true" or "false".
   # A string is expected here, i.e. "true", not true.
   # encrypted: "true"

   # (optional) Use external key management system for encryption passphrases by
   # specifying a unique ID matching KMS ConfigMap. The ID is only used for
   # correlation to configmap entry.
   # encryptionKMSID: <kms-config-id>

   # Add topology constrained pools configuration, if topology based pools
   # are setup, and topology constrained provisioning is required.
