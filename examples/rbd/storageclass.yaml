# If topology based provisioning is desired, delayed provisioning of
# PV is required and is enabled using the following attribute
# For further information read TODO<doc>
# volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
parameters:
   # (required) String representing a Ceph cluster to provision storage from.
   # Should be unique across all Ceph clusters in use for provisioning,
   # cannot be greater than 36 bytes in length, and should remain immutable for
   # the lifetime of the StorageClass in use.
   # Ensure to create an entry in the configmap named ceph-csi-config, based on
   # csi-config-map-sample.yaml, to accompany the string chosen to
   # represent the Ceph cluster in clusterID below
   clusterID: <cluster-id>

   # (optional) If you want to use erasure coded pool with RBD, you need to
   # create two pools. one erasure coded and one replicated.
   # You need to specify the replicated pool here in the `pool` parameter, it is
   # used for the metadata of the images.
   # The erasure coded pool must be set as the `dataPool` parameter below.
   # dataPool: <ec-data-pool>

   # (required) Ceph pool into which the RBD image shall be created
   # eg: pool: rbdpool
   pool: <rbd-pool-name>

   # Set thickProvision to true if you want RBD images to be fully allocated on
   # creation (thin provisioning is the default).
   thickProvision: "false"
   # (required) RBD image features, CSI creates image with image-format 2
   # CSI RBD currently supports only `layering` feature.
   imageFeatures: layering

   # (optional) mapOptions is a comma-separated list of map options.
