parameters:
   # String representing a Ceph cluster to provision storage from.
   # Should be unique across all Ceph clusters in use for provisioning,
   # cannot be greater than 36 bytes in length, and should remain immutable for
   # the lifetime of the StorageClass in use.

   # If you want to use erasure coded pool with RBD, you need to create
   # two pools. one erasure coded and one replicated.
   # You need to specify the replicated pool here in the `pool` parameter, it is
   # used for the metadata of the images.
   # The erasure coded pool must be set as the `dataPool` parameter below.

   # CSI RBD currently supports only `layering` feature.
