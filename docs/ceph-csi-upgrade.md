## Pre-upgrade considerations

In some scenarios there is an issue in the CSI driver that will cause
application pods to be disconnected from their mounts when the CSI driver is
restarted. Since the upgrade would cause the CSI driver to restart if it is
updated, you need to be aware of whether this affects your applications. This
issue will happen when using the Ceph fuse client or rbd-nbd:

CephFS: If you are provision volumes for CephFS and have a kernel less than
version 4.17, The CSI driver will fall back to use the FUSE client.

RBD: If you have set the mounter: rbd-nbd option in the RBD storage class, the
NBD mounter will have this issue.

If you are affected by this issue, you will need to proceed carefully during
the upgrade to restart your application pods. The recommended step is to modify
the update strategy of the CSI nodeplugin daemonsets to OnDelete so that you
can control when the CSI driver pods are restarted on each node.

To avoid this issue in future upgrades, we recommend that you do not use the
fuse client or rbd-nbd as of now.

This guide will walk you through the steps to upgrade the software in a cluster
from v3.0 to v3.1

## Upgrading from v3.1 to v3.2

**Ceph-csi releases from devel are expressly unsupported.** It is strongly
recommended that you use [official
releases](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi/releases) of Ceph-csi. Unreleased
versions from the devel branch are subject to changes and incompatibilities
that will not be supported in the official releases. Builds from the devel
branch can have functionality changed and even removed at any time without
compatibility support and without prior notice.

git checkout v3.2.0 tag

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ceph/ceph-csi.git
cd ./ceph-csi
git checkout v3.2.0
```

**Note:** While upgrading please Ignore warning messages from kubectl output

```console
Warning: kubectl apply should be used on resource created by either kubectl create --save-config or kubectl apply
```

### Upgrading CephFS

Upgrading cephfs csi includes upgrade of cephfs driver and as well as
kubernetes sidecar containers and also the permissions required for the
kubernetes sidecar containers, lets upgrade the things one by one

#### 1. Upgrade CephFS Provisioner resources

Upgrade provisioner resources include updating the provisioner RBAC and
Provisioner deployment

##### 1.1 Update the CephFS Provisioner RBAC

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/cephfs/kubernetes/csi-provisioner-rbac.yaml
serviceaccount/cephfs-csi-provisioner configured
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-external-provisioner-runner configured
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-external-provisioner-runner-rules configured
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-csi-provisioner-role configured
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-external-provisioner-cfg configured
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-csi-provisioner-role-cfg configured
```

##### 1.2 Update the CephFS Provisioner deployment

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/cephfs/kubernetes/csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner.yaml
service/csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner configured
deployment.apps/csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner configured
```

wait for the deployment to complete

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment
NAME                           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner   3/3     1            3           104m
```

deployment UP-TO-DATE value must be same as READY

#### 2. Upgrade CephFS Nodeplugin resources

Upgrading nodeplugin resources include updating the nodeplugin RBAC and
nodeplugin daemonset

##### 2.1 Update the CephFS Nodeplugin RBAC

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/cephfs/kubernetes/csi-nodeplugin-rbac.yaml
serviceaccount/cephfs-csi-nodeplugin configured
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-csi-nodeplugin configured
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-csi-nodeplugin-rules configured
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/cephfs-csi-nodeplugin configured
```

If you determined in [Pre-upgrade considerations](#pre-upgrade-considerations)
that you were affected by the CSI driver restart issue that disconnects the
application pods from their mounts, continue with this section.  Otherwise, you
can skip to step 2.2

```console
vi deploy/cephfs/kubernetes/csi-cephfsplugin.yaml
```

```yaml
kind: DaemonSet
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: csi-cephfsplugin
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: csi-cephfsplugin
  updateStrategy:
    type: OnDelete
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: csi-cephfsplugin
    spec:
      serviceAccount: cephfs-csi-nodeplugin
```

in the above template we have added `updateStrategy` and its `type` to the
daemonset spec

##### 2.2 Update the CephFS Nodeplugin daemonset

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f deploy/cephfs/kubernetes/csi-cephfsplugin.yaml
daemonset.apps/csi-cephfsplugin configured
service/csi-metrics-cephfsplugin configured
```

##### 2.3 Manual deletion of CephFS Nodeplugin daemonset pods

If you determined in [Pre-upgrade considerations](#pre-upgrade-considerations)
that you were affected by the CSI driver restart issue that disconnects the
application pods from their mounts, continue with this section. Otherwise, you
can skip this section.

As we have set the updateStrategy to OnDelete the CSI driver pods will not be
updated until you delete them manually. This allows you to control when your
application pods will be affected by the CSI driver restart.

For each node:

- Drain your application pods from the node
- Delete the CSI driver pods on the node
  - The pods to delete will be named with a csi-cephfsplugin prefix and have a
    random suffix on each node. However, no need to delete the provisioner
    pods: csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner-* .
  - The pod deletion causes the pods to be restarted and updated automatically
    on the node.

we have successfully upgraded cephfs csi from v3.0 to v3.1

### Upgrading RBD

Upgrading rbd csi includes upgrade of rbd driver and as well as kubernetes
sidecar containers and also the permissions required for the kubernetes sidecar
containers, lets upgrade the things one by one

role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/rbd-external-provisioner-cfg configured
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/rbd-csi-provisioner-role-cfg configured
```

    csi-rbdplugin-provisioner-* .
  - The pod deletion causes the pods to be restarted and updated automatically
    on the node.

we have successfully upgraded RBD csi from v3.1 to v3.2

### Handling node reboot hangs due to existing network mounts

With prior versions of ceph-csi a node reboot may hang the reboot process. This
is due to existing cephfs or rbd network mounts not carrying the `_netdev`
mount option. The missing mount option is fixed, and future mounts using
ceph-csi would automatically carry the required flags needed for a clean
reboot.

It is suggested to upgrade to the latest ceph-csi release and drain application
pods on all the nodes so that new mount option `_netdev` can be added to all
the mountpoints.

### CSI Sidecar containers consideration

With 3.2.0 version of ceph-csi we have updated the versions of CSI sidecar
containers. These versions are generally compatible with kubernetes
version>=1.17 but based on the kubernetes version you are using, you need to
update the templates with required sidecar versions.
You also might need to update or remove a few arguments based on the sidecar
versions you are using.
Refer
[sidecar-compatibility](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/sidecar-containers.html)
for more details.
