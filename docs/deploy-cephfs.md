# CSI CephFS plugin

The CSI CephFS plugin is able to both provision new CephFS volumes
and attach and mount existing ones to workloads.

## Building

CSI plugin can be compiled in the form of a binary file or in the form
of a Docker image.
When compiled as a binary file, the result is stored in `_output/`
directory with the name `cephcsi`.
When compiled as an image, it's stored in the local Docker image store
with name `cephcsi`.

Building binary:

```bash
make cephcsi
```

Building Docker image:

```bash
make image-cephcsi
```

## Configuration

**NOTE:** To make CephFS CSI driver version >= 1.1.0 work with Ceph v14.2.2
cluster (not deployed by rook), you need to add the following settings in the
`mgr` section of the ceph.conf used by the Ceph manager daemon, and restart the
Ceph manager daemon.

```
[mgr]
client mount uid = 0
client mount gid = 0
```

This is due to an [issue](http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/40927) in Ceph v14.2.2
that should be resolved in v14.2.3.

**Available environmental variables:**

`KUBERNETES_CONFIG_PATH`: if you use `k8s_configmap` as metadata store, specify
the path of your k8s config file (if not specified, the plugin will assume
you're running it inside a k8s cluster and find the config itself).

**NOTE:** An accompanying CSI configuration file, needs to be provided to the
running pods. Refer to [Creating CSI configuration](../examples/README.md#creating-csi-configuration)
for more information.

**NOTE:** A suggested way to populate and retain uniqueness of the clusterID is
to use the output of `ceph fsid` of the Ceph cluster to be used for
provisioning.

**Required secrets for provisioning:**
Admin credentials are required for provisioning new volumes

* `adminID`: ID of an admin client
* `adminKey`: key of the admin client

**Required secrets for statically provisioned volumes:**
User credentials with access to an existing volume

* `userID`: ID of a user client
* `userKey`: key of a user client

Notes on volume size: when provisioning a new volume, `max_bytes` quota
attribute for this volume will be set to the requested volume size (see [Ceph
quota documentation](http://docs.ceph.com/docs/nautilus/cephfs/quota/)). A request
for a zero-sized volume means no quota attribute will be set.

## Deployment with Kubernetes

Requires Kubernetes 1.14+

Use the [cephfs templates](../deploy/cephfs/kubernetes)

Your Kubernetes cluster must allow privileged pods (i.e. `--allow-privileged`
flag must be set to true for both the API server and the kubelet). Moreover, as
stated in the [mount propagation
docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation),
the Docker daemon of the cluster nodes must allow shared mounts.

YAML manifests are located in `deploy/cephfs/kubernetes`.

**Deploy RBACs for sidecar containers and node plugins:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-provisioner-rbac.yaml
kubectl create -f csi-nodeplugin-rbac.yaml
```

Those manifests deploy service accounts, cluster roles and cluster role
bindings. These are shared for both RBD and CephFS CSI plugins, as they require
the same permissions.

**Deploy PodSecurityPolicy resources for sidecar containers and node plugins:**

**NOTE:** These manifests are required only if [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podsecuritypolicy)
admission controller is active on your cluster.

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-provisioner-psp.yaml
kubectl create -f csi-nodeplugin-psp.yaml
```

**Deploy ConfigMap for CSI plugins:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-config-map.yaml
```

The configmap deploys an empty CSI configuration that is mounted as a volume
within the Ceph CSI plugin pods. To add a specific Ceph clusters configuration
details, refer to [Creating CSI configuration](../examples/README.md#creating-csi-configuration)
for more information.

**Deploy Ceph configuration ConfigMap for CSI pods:**

```bash
kubectl create -f ../example/ceph-config.yaml
```

**Deploy CSI sidecar containers:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner.yaml
```

Deploys deployment of provision which includes external-provisioner
,external-attacher for CSI CephFS.

**Deploy CSI CephFS driver:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-cephfsplugin.yaml
```

Deploys a daemon set with two containers: CSI node-driver-registrar and
the CSI CephFS driver.

**NOTE:**
In case you want to use a different release version, replace canary with the
release version in the
[provisioner](../deploy/cephfs/kubernetes/csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner.yaml)
and [nodeplugin](../deploy/cephfs/kubernetes/csi-cephfsplugin.yaml) YAMLs.

```yaml
# for stable functionality replace canary with latest release version
    image: quay.io/cephcsi/cephcsi:canary
```

Check the release version [here.](../README.md#ceph-csi-container-images-and-release-compatibility)

## Verifying the deployment in Kubernetes

After successfully completing the steps above, you should see output similar to this:

```bash
$ kubectl get all
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner-0   4/4       Running   0          25s
pod/csi-cephfsplugin-rljcv           3/3       Running   0          24s

NAME                                   TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
service/csi-cephfsplugin-provisioner   ClusterIP   10.101.78.75     <none>        8080/TCP   26s
...
```

Once the CSI plugin configuration is updated with details from a Ceph cluster of
choice, you can try deploying a demo pod from examples/cephfs using the
instructions [provided](../examples/README.md#deploying-the-storage-class) to
test the deployment further.

### Notes on volume deletion

Dynamically povisioned volumes are deleted by the driver, when requested to
do so. Statically provisioned volumes, from plugin versions less than or
equal to 1.0.0, are a no-op when a delete operation is performed against the
same, and are expected to be deleted on the Ceph cluster by the user.

## Deployment with Helm

The same requirements from the Kubernetes section apply here, i.e. Kubernetes
version, privileged flag and shared mounts.

The Helm chart is located in `charts/ceph-csi-cephfs`.
