# CSI RBD Plugin

The RBD CSI plugin is able to provision new RBD images and
attach and mount those to workloads.

## Building

CSI plugin can be compiled in a form of a binary file or in a form of a
Docker image. When compiled as a binary file, the result is stored in
`_output/` directory with the name `cephcsi`. When compiled as an image, it's
stored in the local Docker image store with name `cephcsi`.

Building binary:

```bash
make cephcsi
```

Building Docker image:

```bash
make image-cephcsi
```

## Configuration

**Available command line arguments:**

| Option                   | Default value         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**NOTE:** An accompanying CSI configuration file, needs to be provided to the
running pods. Refer to [Creating CSI configuration](../examples/README.md#creating-csi-configuration)
for more information.

**NOTE:** A suggested way to populate and retain uniqueness of the clusterID is
to use the output of `ceph fsid` of the Ceph cluster to be used for
provisioning.

**Required secrets:**

User credentials, with required access to the pool being used in the storage class,
is required for provisioning new RBD images.

## Deployment with Kubernetes

Requires Kubernetes 1.14+

Use the [rbd templates](../deploy/rbd/kubernetes)

Your Kubernetes cluster must allow privileged pods (i.e. `--allow-privileged`
flag must be set to true for both the API server and the kubelet). Moreover, as
stated in the [mount propagation
docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation),
the Docker daemon of the cluster nodes must allow shared mounts.

YAML manifests are located in `deploy/rbd/kubernetes`.

**Deploy RBACs for sidecar containers and node plugins:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-provisioner-rbac.yaml
kubectl create -f csi-nodeplugin-rbac.yaml
```

Those manifests deploy service accounts, cluster roles and cluster role
bindings. These are shared for both RBD and CephFS CSI plugins, as they require
the same permissions.

**Deploy PodSecurityPolicy resources for sidecar containers and node plugins:**

**NOTE:** These manifests are required only if [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podsecuritypolicy)
admission controller is active on your cluster.

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-provisioner-psp.yaml
kubectl create -f csi-nodeplugin-psp.yaml
```

**Deploy ConfigMap for CSI plugins:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-config-map.yaml
```

The configmap deploys an empty CSI configuration that is mounted as a volume
within the Ceph CSI plugin pods. To add a specific Ceph clusters configuration
details, refer to [Creating CSI configuration for RBD based
provisioning](../examples/README.md#creating-csi-configuration-for-rbd-based-provisioning)
for more information.

**Deploy CSI sidecar containers:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-rbdplugin-provisioner.yaml
```

Deploys stateful set of provision which includes external-provisioner
,external-attacher,csi-snapshotter sidecar containers and CSI RBD plugin.

**Deploy RBD CSI driver:**

```bash
kubectl create -f csi-rbdplugin.yaml
```

Deploys a daemon set with two containers: CSI node-driver-registrar and the CSI
RBD driver.

## Verifying the deployment in Kubernetes

After successfully completing the steps above, you should see output similar to this:

```bash
$ kubectl get all
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/csi-rbdplugin-fptqr           3/3       Running   0          21s
pod/csi-rbdplugin-provisioner-0   5/5       Running   0          22s

NAME                                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
service/csi-rbdplugin-provisioner   ClusterIP   10.104.2.130   <none>        8080/TCP   23s
...
```

Once the CSI plugin configuration is updated with details from a Ceph cluster of
choice, you can try deploying a demo pod from examples/rbd using the
instructions [provided](../examples/README.md#deploying-the-storage-class) to
test the deployment further.

## Deployment with Helm

The same requirements from the Kubernetes section apply here, i.e. Kubernetes
version, privileged flag and shared mounts.

The Helm chart is located in `charts/ceph-csi-rbd`.

**Deploy Helm Chart:**

[See the Helm chart readme for installation instructions.](../charts/ceph-csi-rbd/README.md)

## Encryption for RBD volumes

> Enabling encryption on volumes created without encryption is **not supported**
>
> Enabling encryption for storage class that has PVs created without encryption
> is **not supported**

Volumes provisioned with Ceph RBD do not have encryption by default. It is
possible to encrypt them with ceph-csi by using LUKS encryption.

To enable encryption set `encrypted` option in storage class to `"true"` and
set encryption passphrase in kubernetes secrets under `encryptionPassphrase` key.

To use different passphrase you need to have different storage classes and point
to a different K8s secrets (different `csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-name`
and `csi.storage.k8s.io/node-stage-secret-namespace`).

### Life-cycle for encrypted volumes

**Create volume**:

* create volume request received
* volume requested to be created in Ceph
* encrypted state "requiresEncryption" is saved in image-meta in Ceph

**Attach volume**:

* attach volume request received
* volume is attached to provisioner container
* on first time attachment
  (no file system on the attached device, checked with blkid)
  * new passphrase is generated and stored in selected KMS if KMS is in use
  * device is encrypted with LUKS using a passphrase from K8s secrets
  * image-meta updated to "encrypted" in Ceph
* passphrase is retrieved from selected KMS if KMS is in use
* device is open and device path is changed to use a mapper device
* mapper device is used instead of original one with usual workflow

**Detach volume**:

* mapper device closed and device path changed to original volume path
* volume is detached as usual
* passphrase removed from KMS if needed (with failures ignored)

### Encryption configuration

To encrypt rbd volumes with LUKS you need to set encryption passphrase in
secrets under `encryptionPassphrase` key and switch `encrypted` option in
StorageClass to `"true"`. This is not supported for storage classes that already
have PVs provisioned.

### Encryption KMS configuration

To further improve security robustness it is possible to use unique passphrases
generated for each volume and stored in a Key Management System (KMS). Currently
HashiCorp Vault is the only KMS supported.

To use Vault as KMS set `encryptionKMSID` to a unique identifier for Vault
configuration. You will also need to create vault configuration similar to the
[example](../examples/rbd/kms-config.yaml) and use same `encryptionKMSID`.
Configuration must include `encryptionKMSType: "vault"`. In order for ceph-csi
to be able to access the configuration you will need to have it mounted to
csi-rbdplugin containers in both daemonset (so kms client can be instantiated to
encrypt/decrypt volumes) and deployment pods (so kms client can be instantiated
to delete passphrase on volume delete) `ceph-csi-encryption-kms-config`
configmap.

> Note: kms configuration must be a map of string values only
> (`map[string]string`) so for numerical and boolean values make sure to put
> quotes around.

#### Configuring HashiCorp Vault

Using Vault as KMS you need to configure Kubernetes authentication method as
described in [official
documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes.html).

If token reviewer is used, you will need to configure service account for
that also like in [example](../examples/rbd/csi-vaulttokenreview-rbac.yaml) to
be able to review jwt tokens.

Configure a role(s) for service accounts used for ceph-csi:

* provisioner service account (`rbd-csi-provisioner`) requires only **delete**
  permissions to delete passphrases on PVC delete
* nodeplugin service account (`rbd-csi-nodeplugin`) requires **create** and
  **read** permissions to save new keys and retrieve existing

### Encryption prerequisites

In order for encryption to work you need to make sure that `dm-crypt` kernel
module is enabled on the nodes running ceph-csi attachers.

If custom image is built for the rbd-plugin instance, make sure that it contains
`cryptsetup` tool installed to be able to use encryption.
