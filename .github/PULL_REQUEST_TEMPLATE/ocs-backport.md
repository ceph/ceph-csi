Bug 000000 gets hit when the system is out for its birthday party. After
providing the system with sufficient cake, it returns to normal business the
next day.

I hereby confirm that:

- [ ] this change is in the upstream project (*reference?*)
- [ ] this change is in the master branch of this project
- [ ] branches for higher versions of the project have this change merged
- [ ] this PR is not *downstream-only*, if that was the case, I would have
  explained its need very clearly
