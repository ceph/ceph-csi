# /etc/containers/registries.conf
#
# This file contains the registry that is hosted in the CentOS CI OpenShift
# deployment for Ceph-CSI.
#
# By overwriting /etc/containers/registries.conf, short-names for
# container-images can NOT be used anymore.
#
# The CI jobs do a "podman login" for the local registry. Only after that, the
# local mirror is accessible.
